I developed and edited the Sekford Journal, a newsletter that offered monthly insights into the people, ideas and places that shaped London-based watch brand [Sekford](https://www.instagram.com/sekford/).

- Margot Henderson
- Michael Craig-Martin
- Michel Roux Jr.

I also conceived and produced an event during the London Design Festival that celebrated the brandâ€™s passion for craftsmanship and the history of design through a live demonstration of the art of lettercutting in stone. The event was covered by [<cite>Wallpaper\*</cite>](https://www.wallpaper.com/design/sekford-and-salvatori-carve-out-a-timeline-of-typography).
