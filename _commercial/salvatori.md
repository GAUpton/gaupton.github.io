I worked with Italian design brand [Salvatori](https://www.salvatoriofficial.com/en/gb/) to develop and deliver a new editorial strategy, communicating the companyâ€™s evolution from specialists in natural stone to a leading global design brand. In addition to publications and communications materials, I produced interviews and features exploring the brand and its values.
